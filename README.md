# Food-App-React-Native
This is a food recipe app that I have created for Android using React Native. 

To run it, clone the repository into your editor of choice. 

Then, execute the command 'npx react-native start' to start the react native server.

Finally, run the command 'npx react-native run-android' with an emulator open, to connect the emulator to the server.
